# 📈 Quantitative Portfolio Management – Final Project

This project builds a robust portfolio optimization framework combining traditional mean-variance models with enhancements like shrinkage covariance estimation and regime-aware asset allocation. Designed for real-world application and academic insight.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Construct optimized portfolios under varying market conditions
- Apply shrinkage techniques for more stable covariance estimates
- Evaluate risk-adjusted returns and portfolio turnover

## 📁 File
- `QPM_Final Project.ipynb`: Full implementation, logic, and results in Jupyter Notebook format.

## 📊 Techniques Used
- Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz framework)
- Shrinkage Covariance Matrix (Ledoit-Wolf)
- Regime-based allocation logic
- Turnover and Sharpe ratio performance metrics

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Open notebook in JupyterLab or Google Colab
2. Install dependencies: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
3. Run cells sequentially to reproduce portfolio construction and analysis

## 📈 Key Outcomes
- Demonstrated improved Sharpe ratio with stable covariance estimation
- Visualized portfolio weights under different market regimes
- Reduced overfitting through shrinkage and smoothing methods
